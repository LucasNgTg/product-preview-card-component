## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS variables
- HTML picture

### What I learned

I used CSS variables to store the design colours, font families and font sizes. Certainly something I'll do again in the future. Made the mobile page first, which I hadn't done before. Apparently, that is the approach suitable to the market.

Used the `picture` tag in order to change the image depending on the screen size. It turns out that the element that is displayed on the page is always the `img`, with `source` only being there as an override of some attributes depending on specified parameters.

I should use the CSS Grid more often.

### Continued development

Responsiveness is harder than it seems. Definetely something that requires practical experience to fully grasp.
